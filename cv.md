## About
For a large part of my professional life, I have worked in the HR department. At the age of 30, I realized that this is not the direction I want to develop in. So I decided to change my profession. The direction of IT was always interesting for me, but there was no opportunity to get a second higher education. So when various courses for changing specialization appeared, I decided to try myself. Now my main goal is to gain knowledge and start my career in the area that is really interesting to me.
